In this experiment, thirty subjects had data collected for their metrics with regards to different types of activities for exercise.  

Each person in the experiment wore a sensor that recorded data from accelerometers and gyroscopes  and had a series of pre-processed data techniques applied.  By the time we have obtained the data,  these pre-processed techniques had already been applied.

Activities these subjects performed were one of six: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying down.  
 561 variables were collected for each activity over multiple observations.  
The  final data analysis produces a tidy dataset contains the following  data points
1.  SUBJECTS:
Numbered 1-30.  No names are given
2.  ACTIVITY.LABEL:
1 is Walking
2 is Walking Upstairs
3 is Walking Downstairs
4 is Sitting
5 is Standing
6 is Laying
3.  Colums 3 - 563: are  561  data points that are collected along with the experiment.  The description for this can be found in file features.txt.  They will not be documented here.
